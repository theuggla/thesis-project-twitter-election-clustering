# thesis-project-twitter-election-clustering
The goal of this degree project is to explore whether it is possible to :

(a) use an implementation of the ClusTop algorithm suggested by Hui Lim, Karunasekera, and Harwood [[1]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321050909_ClusTop_A_Clustering-based_Topic_Modelling_Algorithm_for_Twitter_using_Word_Networks) to identify topics connected to tweets about Trump and Clinton just before the American 2016 election, and 

(b) distinguish between the topics used in connection with a specific candidate in states where they won versus states where they lost the election

The result could then be used as a basis for an investigation into whether topics discussed could be used to predict election results.
